Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques are becoming 
more relevant on several research fields for which scientists rely on computational 
frameworks such as Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch etc. which are specially 
designed to facilitate the development of Machine and Deep learning applications for
research and commercial objectives. These frameworks provide a full set of libraries
that allow researchers become productive within a relatively small amount of time 
and with a minimum knowledge of traditional MPI and GPU programming (ML and DL 
frameworks are commonly already GPU-accelerated).

This course will focus Machine Learning applications through the introduction of 
basic concepts and categories, the common workflow of application development through
some simple examples, and some challenges and advantages of transitioning to HPC 
systems.
